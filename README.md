# CloudX

## Cloud X is a DDoS tool that can break ( pass through ) to the https protocol.

HTTPS itself is a secure version of a protocol, but HTTP is not so website that uses HTTP has a chance of being attacked by DDoS

CloudX is new and still has a error so don't have much expectations about this.

( My grammar is bad )
