## What is CloudX?
CloudX is a DDoS tool that can break ( pass through ) to the https protocol.

## What is HTTPS/HTTP?
Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer and 

HTTPS itself is a secure version of a protocol, but HTTP is not so website that still use HTTP protocol has a 55% chance of being attacked by DDoS

CloudX is new and has many error so don't have much expectations about this program.
