# CloudX

- Introduction
Hello! my name is sunshine, im 11 years old and i am from Indonesia, Elementary school
 
## Cloud X is a DDoS tool that can break ( pass through ) to the https protocol.

HTTPS itself is a secure version of a protocol, but HTTP is not so website that uses HTTP has a chance of being attacked by DDoS

CloudX is new and still has a error so don't have much expectations about this.

( My grammar is bad )

## To run
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; git clone https://github.com/vzexg/CloudX; cd CloudX; ulimit -n 999999; sudo python3 CloudX
